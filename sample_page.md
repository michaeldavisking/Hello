## Particles

**Project description:** 

Particles is an interactive Virtual Reality experience where the guest is able to push around small orbs using their hands.

This project was displayed in the 2024 pop-up exhibition at Bird Block Gallery and Ceramics Studio “Bird Bonk”. It was made to be a simple interaction so that all ages and experience levels would be able to put on the headset and understand what to do.
